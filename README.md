# VaccinationSystem-DB
This is the final project of the database course, which is an implementation of a vaccination system database using `SQL`. Three types of people, such as **Doctors**, **Nurses** and **People** are supported in this system with various capabilities. 
## Tables
The information of each user includes 2 parts: **System info** and **User Info**. The user info of all members is the same, but their personal info differs based on their rules.
The information of health centers, the history of vaccination, the bard of vaccines and their vial should be recorded.

Mentioned items are â€Œrecognizeable by checking out [the tables](https://github.com/tanya-jp/VaccinationSystem-DB/blob/main/tables.sql).

## Users
The users need to sign up and create an account to be able to use this platform. The user type determines the user's access and operations.

### Doctors' Operations
1. [Adding New Brand](https://github.com/tanya-jp/VaccinationSystem-DB/blob/main/add%20brand.sql)
2. [Adding New Health Center](https://github.com/tanya-jp/VaccinationSystem-DB/blob/main/add%20health%20center.sql)
3. [Deleting Accounts](https://github.com/tanya-jp/VaccinationSystem-DB/blob/main/delete%20account.sql)

### Nurses' Operations
There are four types of nurses: **Matron**, **Supervisor**, **Nurse** and **Paramadic**, and their responsibilities  are based on their types.
1. [Vial Creation](https://github.com/tanya-jp/VaccinationSystem-DB/blob/main/vial%20creation.sql): Metrons
2. [Injection](https://github.com/tanya-jp/VaccinationSystem-DB/blob/main/injection.sql): All Four Types

### People's Operations
Each member, such as people, doctors and nurses, should be able to 
1. [View Their Account Info](https://github.com/tanya-jp/VaccinationSystem-DB/blob/main/view%20information.sql)
2. [Change Their Password](https://github.com/tanya-jp/VaccinationSystem-DB/blob/main/change%20pass.sql)
3. [Score](https://github.com/tanya-jp/VaccinationSystem-DB/blob/main/socre.sql)  
4. [View the Score of Centers](https://github.com/tanya-jp/VaccinationSystem-DB/blob/main/viewQueries.sql)
5. [View the Number of Vaccinated People of Each Brand](https://github.com/tanya-jp/VaccinationSystem-DB/blob/main/viewQueries.sql)
6. [Vies the Top 3 Centers for Each Brand](https://github.com/tanya-jp/VaccinationSystem-DB/blob/main/viewQueries.sql)
7. [Viewing the Possible Center for Their Second Doses](https://github.com/tanya-jp/VaccinationSystem-DB/blob/main/viewQueries.sql)
